### Installation

```bash
npm install -g gulp # Not required if you already have gulp installed globally
npm install -g bower # Not required if you already have bower installed globally
npm install
bower install
gulp build
gulp webserver
```

### How the installation works

The installation will create all necessary and translated files into the folder 'dist' and its substructure.
